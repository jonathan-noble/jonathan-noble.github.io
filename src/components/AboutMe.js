                I was born in the Philippines, but I have been living in Dublin, Ireland half of my life now. I have recently achieved my Bachelor's degree
                in <b>Computer Science International</b> at Technological University Dublin. During my third year Erasmus programme in Darmstadt, Germany,
                I have also attained another Bachelor's degree in <b>Computer Science</b> at Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences.
