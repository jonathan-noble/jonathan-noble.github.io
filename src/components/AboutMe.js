                I was born in the Philippines, but I have been living in Dublin, Ireland more than half of my life now. I have achieved my Bachelor's degree
                in <b>Computer Science International</b> at Technological University Dublin. During my third year Erasmus programme in Darmstadt, Germany,
                I have also attained another Bachelor's degree in <b>Computer Science</b> at Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences.

            <br/>

            <p> 
                Throughout the two degrees, I have developed several applications with various technologies that are on demand, 
                and gained experience working under the Scrum Agile methodology.
                The key projects are highlighted below in the <b>portfolio</b>. Check them out!
